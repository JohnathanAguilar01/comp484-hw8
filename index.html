        <h1>Johnathan Aguilar</h1>
        <h2>Computer Science Student and AI/ML Undergraduate Fellowship Researcher at CSUN</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Computer Science student at California State University, Northridge, with a 3.95 GPA and a minor in Data Science.
          I have a solid background in machine learning, software engineering, database systems, algorithms, and computer networking.
          My experience includes both academic research and hands-on development, where I design and improve software solutions in a variety of settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am skilled in Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL. I have built full-stack applications and analytical tools using React,
          Express.js, PyQt5, MySQL, AWS, and Node.js. My projects include both desktop and web systems, as well as secure cloud applications ready for production.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond technical development, I bring several years of professional experience in high-responsibility roles, which have strengthened my communication,
          problem-solving, and team collaboration skills. I am proficient in industry-standard workflows and tools, including Git, GitHub, GitHub Projects,
          JIRA, and Docker, and work comfortably in both Linux and Windows environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am motivated by curiosity and a desire to make a real impact. I am seeking opportunities to work on projects that challenge my analytical skills, 
          deepen my understanding of AI systems, and support my research interests in AI agents.
